### List of challenges

- Developer tooling ecosystem
    - [Puppet PDK](https://github.com/puppetlabs/pdk)
        - Open issues: https://github.com/puppetlabs/pdk/issues
    - [Puppet Rspec](https://github.com/puppetlabs/rspec-puppet)
        - RSpec tests for your Puppet manifests & modules
        - Open issues: https://github.com/puppetlabs/rspec-puppet/issues
    - [Puppet Litmus](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet_litmus)
        - Litmus is a command line tool that allows you to run acceptance tests against Puppet modules
        - Open issues https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet_litmus/issues
    - [Puppet VS Code extension](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-vscode)
        - Open issues https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-vscode/issues
    - [Provision](https://github.com/puppetlabs/provision)
        - When provisioning to GCP fails, make `provision::provision_service provisioner` retry on 500 error responses, there should be a MAX RETRY set though (3). So, the CI doesn‚Äôt fail due to provisioning failures.
        - Previous attempts: https://github.com/puppetlabs/provision/pull/194
    - [Puppet Code Validator](https://validate.puppet.com/)
        - Open issues: https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-validator/issues
    - [Puppet Spec Helper](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs_spec_helper)
        - Open issues: https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs_spec_helper/issues
    - [PE Status Check](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-pe_status_check)
        - lookup indicator_exclusions from hiera pe_status check
        - Related issue on Github: https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-pe_status_check/issues/127
    - Rubocop offenses
        - Help us to fix Rubocop offenses from our tooling and modules.
        - This is a good way to get to know a new project, by making small changes to reduce the number of Rubocop offenses in a project.
        - This is just one example about a [rubocop TO DO file from the PDK project](https://github.com/puppetlabs/pdk/blob/main/.rubocop_todo.yml)
        - The best approach to fix these would be to:
            - find repos with a `.rubocop_todo.yml`
            - Look at the rules that have been excluded
            - Comment one out
            - Run bundle exec rubocop
            - Commit your changes :)
        - Here is the general search on all our public Github repos that use a `.rubocop_todo.yml` file that has active filters: https://github.com/search?q=org%3Apuppetlabs+path%3A.rubocop_todo.yml+%2F%5E.*%5C%2F.*%3A%24%2F&type=code
    - [Forge Ruby Gem](https://github.com/puppetlabs/forge-ruby)
        - Issue: This library (gem) currently does no response caching of its own, instead opting to re-issue every request each time.
- General help needed
    - [Puppet's repositories labeled as `hacktoberfest`](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Ahacktoberfest+org%3Apuppetlabs+fork%3Atrue&type=repositories)
- Greenfield solutions
    - Build a module‚Äôs legacy facts scanner, it should receive an optional parameter (replace=true) to replace automatically the legacy facts for current facts
- Bring your own challenge
    - Maybe you have a bug that has been bothering you for some time now, or you want to improve a feature that your work depends on. Work on something that motivates you üòä
    - You are not familiar with Puppet's Dev tooling ecosystem but you still want to contribute in a module? Please feel free to do that üôå
